# Website_Blocker
The project aimed to create a Python-based Website Blocker tool to restrict access to specific websites to enhance focus because unrestricted internet usage can lead to distractions, security threats, and reduced productivity. 

In this project, Python-based website blocker modifies the systemâ€™s hosts file to redirect unwanted websites to 127.0.0.1 (localhost), preventing users from accessing them. The objective of this project is to create a GUI-based website blocker with help of Tkinter library for windows as well as Linux, which will also have an option to unblock those websites.
